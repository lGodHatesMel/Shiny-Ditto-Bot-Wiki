# SWSH ITEM TRADES

Just looking for certain items and don't care about the pokemon? Then you can do this. 

`!swshitemtrade ItemName` 

Then you will get a DM from @Shiny Ditto with a trade like code. Trade Ditto a pokemon you don't want, and it will trade you back a random pokemon holding the item you wanted. 

*Example:*

`!swshitemtrade Rare Candy`
